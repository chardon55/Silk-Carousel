# Slideshow_Banner
This repository contains script for making an HTML banner that can do slideshow.

The script now can only work properly on Google Chrome. I'm trying to improve its compatibility.

Tips to use it:
  ->  Make sure your HTML file has imported jQuery js-file, because the script needs it
  ->  To activate the script, you just need a <div></div> whose id is "banner"
  ->  You can change how many the elements of arrays are, because the script will adjust the banner depending on it
