# Slideshow_Banner
This repository contains script for making an HTML banner that can do slideshow.

The script now can only work properly on Google Chrome. I'm trying to improve its compatibility.

<h2>Tips to use it:</h2>
  <p>->  Make sure your HTML file has imported jQuery js-file, because the script needs it</p>
  <p>->  To activate the script, you just need a div tag whose id is "banner"</p>
  <p>->  You can change how many the elements of arrays are, because the script will adjust the banner depending on it</p>
