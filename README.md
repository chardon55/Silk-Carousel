# Slideshow_Banner
This repository contains script for making an HTML banner that can do slideshow.

<i>The script now can only work properly on Google Chrome. I'm trying to improve its compatibility.</i>

<h2>Tips to use it:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure your HTML file has imported jQuery js-file, because the script needs it</li>
  <li>To activate the script, you just need a div tag whose id is "banner"</li>
  <li>You can change how many elements of arrays are, because the script will adjust the banner depending on it</li>
</ul>
